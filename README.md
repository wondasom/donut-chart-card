## üé® Design Decisions & Framework Choices

- The main goal in terms of design was to make it look identical as possible with the given example,
  - by making/using the same color palette(![#c4366f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c4366f/000000?text=+) `#c4366f`, ![#85adff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/85adff/000000?text=+) `#85adff`, ![#502579](https://via.placeholder.com/15/502579/000000?text=+) `#502579`).
  - by using similar typography.
  - by implementing similar layout.

## üíØ Areas for Improvements & Questions

- Why did AJAX not work when the json file was in the `src` folder, but did work in the `public` folder?
- What would be the better way of writing `handleClone` funtion (in case you want to insert an element into specific index of an array)?
- What is the best way of making dashed line _without_ using background image?
- Time to learn **Jest**!
- How to update state on prop changes?
  - Why is `componentWillRecieveProps` UNSAFE?
