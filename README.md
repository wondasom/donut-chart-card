## üé® Design Decisions & Framework Choices

- The main goal in terms of design was to make it look identical as possible with the given example,
  - by making/using the same color palette(![#c4366f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c4366f/000000?text=+) `#c4366f`, ![#85adff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/85adff/000000?text=+) `#85adff`, ![#502579](https://via.placeholder.com/15/502579/000000?text=+) `#502579`).
  - by using similar typography([Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?preview.text=12187&preview.text_type=custom&selection.family=Noto+Sans:wght@700|Nunito:wght@300;400;600;700;800&sidebar.open=true&query=nunito), [Noto-Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?preview.text=12187&preview.text_type=custom&selection.family=Noto+Sans:wght@700|Nunito:wght@300;400;600;700;800&sidebar.open=true)).
  - by implementing similar layout.
- I was tempted to work with Vue.js but with the time constraint, I chose React.js which I feel more comfortable to work with.

## üíØ Areas for Improvements & Questions

- Why did AJAX not work when the JSON file was in the `src` folder but did work in the `public` folder?
- What would be the better way of writing the `handleClone` function (in case you want to insert an element into a specific index of an array)?
- What is the best way of making dashed line _without_ using the background image?
- Time to learn **Jest**!
- How to update the state on prop changes?
  - Why is `componentWillRecieveProps` UNSAFE?
